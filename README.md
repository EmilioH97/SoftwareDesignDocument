# SoftwareDesignDocument

Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
In this assignment I was tasked with creating a report for The Gaming Room. I created a software design document to show the design concepts to be used across different operating systems.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did well explaining the server and client side and the deveopment tools in the evalution portion of the document. I think I did well explaining differences in all of the operating software.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML diagram is used to create an easy to understand diagram of the classes that are used when writing code and developing the software used for creating the web based game. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to correct my my operating systems architechures section of the recommendations. I would need to explain in better detail the differences between client/server, serverless, and microservices architecture.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I explained the requirements needed accross all operating systems to better achieve the goal of the web based game. I was tasked with finding the best option for creating a game that can be played accross all systems including mobile phones with one operating systems used to develop the software.
